# Scala solutions for Advent of Code 2016

I've been solving the puzzles on http://adventofcode.com/ in Scala. Here are my solutions.

## Compiling and running
I've been using IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin and Scala Worksheets.
By default, IntelliJ runs the worksheets in the NailgunRunner process that also does the compilation.
A couple solutions take more than the default allotted memory.
In IDEA you can up the JVM maximum heap size in Preferences, Scala Compile Server.
